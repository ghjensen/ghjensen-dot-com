Welcome to my customized Hugo siteâ€”a place for me to showcase some of my academic and digital humanities work while experimenting with yet another static site generator. 

**Note**: This site is based on Hugoplate, a Hugo + Tailwind CSS Starter and Boilerplate theme developed by [Zeon Studio](https://zeon.studio/).
