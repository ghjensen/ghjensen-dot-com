A SSHRC-funded digital archive of previously unpublished correspondence by the English modernist writer Mary Butts. It is led by Principal Investigator Dr. Joel Hawkes and contains letters, contextual scholarly materials, metadata databases, a photo gallery, and more. The letters are from, and digitized with the support of, University of Victoria Libraries – Special Collections & Archives’s Douglas Goldring fonds, Yale University Library - Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, University at Buffalo - University Libraries, Harry Ransom Center - University of Texas at Austin, and Wheaton College - Archives & Special Collections.

For this project, I served as the lead web developer and also helped design and develop TEI templates and schema to meet the project's research metadata and infrastructure needs. With Dr. Hawkes, I launched the website at the 2023 Modernist Studies Conference in Brooklyn.
