_Mapping Alcohol Consumption in F. Scott Fitzgerald's "May Day": A Digital Critical Edition_ will be an annotated edition of the 1920 public-domain text of “May Day,” featuring an integrated map, critical apparatus, and sample lesson plans. TEI mark-up of the text facilitates interactive DH assignments for my “[Alcohol in/and Modernist Fiction](https://engl480.ghjensen.com/)” course.
