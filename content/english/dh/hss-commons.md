The Canadian HSS Commons is in-development, national-scale, bilingual network for Canadian Humanities and Social Sciences researchers to share, access, re-purpose, and develop scholarly projects, publications, educational resources, data, and tools. It is being developed by the Implementing New Knowledge Environments Partnership with the Electronic Textual Cultures Lab, University of Victoria Systems, Compute Canada, CANARIE, the Canadian Research Knowledge Network, the Canadian Association of Research Libraries, the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences, the Humanities Commons, the University of Newcastle, and others.

My role on this project is co-lead of research, development, and strategy. In this role, I meet with our national and international research partners, and I have supervised the work of developers and graduate and undergraduate research assistants from Bangladesh, Canada, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Vietnam, and the United States. I have also published [research](/research/) on the HSS Commons and other digital knowledge commons or academic social networking sites, and I have given [plenary talks, papers, workshops, and demos](/research/) at events based in Canada, Australia, the United States, India, Korea, Italy, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates.
