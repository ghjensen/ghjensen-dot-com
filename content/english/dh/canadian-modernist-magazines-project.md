The **[Canadian Modernist Magazines Project](https://modernistmags.ca/)** (CMMP) is a digital repository of modernist periodical literature published in Canada (ca. 1900-1960). Led by Principal Investigator Dr. Graham Jensen, the project's primary aim is to digitize and transcribe a selection of Canadian literary “little magazines” so that they can be read, searched, downloaded, analyzed, and taught. As a repository of Canadian modernist periodicals, the CMMP makes important but difficult-to-access literary texts available to scholars as well as to the broader public. But the CMMP will not simply provide easy access to texts; in its next phase, it will also feature critical introductions of select Canadian modernist magazines, tools for computational analysis of the transcribed texts, sample lesson plans, and relevant syllabi.

The CMMP started by digitizing complete runs of two foundational Canadian modernist magazines, _**Preview**_ (1942-44) and **_First Statement_** (1942-45). Once these initial digitization goals were met, it digitized **_Neith_** (1903-04) and **_Le Nigog_** (1918).

The CMMP was funded by the [Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca) and a stipend from [Editing Modernism in Canada](http://editingmodernism.ca/).
